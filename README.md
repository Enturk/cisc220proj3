# cisc220proj3
TL;DR: find scrabble words given a specified rack

For this project you're going to design code to give the highest scoring plays given a particular rack, board, and dictionary.

Your goal: produce a list of the top 20 highest scoring plays for that player (perhaps with x,y coordinates and a direction (right or down)). 
Think deep about (or research obscureâ€¦) data structures that can help you do this in close to real time. You will receive the rack and board 
in a format I chose for this project. I will give you a dictionary to use. Also I will provide you a Python script and some instructions for 
creating this board format from a real, live, game of Scrabble from facebook (YMMV).

Output format:
The first row will contain the tiles from your rack. (* for wild-card.)
The board is 15x15 and it is on the next 15 rows which contain 15 characters each.
A - is an empty space.
A capital letter is a tile which has been played.
A 2 is a double letter tile.
A 3 is a triple letter tile.
A 4 is a double word tile.
A 9 is a triple word tile.

Functionality and problems:

1. Main calls boardGen (in consumer) to import saved text file into board.

    a. #includes may prevent compiling 
    b. Needs a UI (load question)

2. Main calls rackGen (in consumer) to import saved text file into rack
3. Main calls movesGen to accumulate possible moves 
   
    a. #includes may prevent compiling 

4.  Main sorts moves by score
5.  trim list to top 20.
6.  print out moves (with option to display them on a board)
